    "New York City, NYC, is the most populated city in the USA and largest metropolitan area in the world. NYC has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, and exerts a significant impact upon commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. Many districts and landmarks in New York City are well known, including three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013; a record 62.8 million tourists visited in 2017. Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the world.\n",

Manhattan has been described as the cultural, financial, media, and entertainment capital of the world. Manhattan hosts three of the world's 10 most-visited tourist attractions in 2013: Times Square, Central Park, and Grand Central Terminal. As one of world’s greatest tourists’ destination, tourism is vital to Manhattan's economy, and the landmarks of Manhattan are the focus of New York City's tourists. As of June 2016, Manhattan had nearly 91,500 hotel rooms, a 26% increase from 2010.\n",

Most of the data is available in a json file at https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset , though it is missing few neighborhoods which are part of our AirBnB dataset. For the missing ones, I used geocoder api to get the co-ordinates. As we get the data, I have created a csv file, NY_MH_NEIGHBORHOODS.csv , which can be used for subsequent executions. This saves execution time by removing the outgoing network calls for geocoder api, and json file and parsing of json file for required data."

I shall also use the geo data co-ordinates for FourSquare API to get venues in a neighborhoods. Then I shall work to minimize the number of venue categories as Four Square API will return 220+ categories. This almost nullifies the clustering as most of them will be having zero values for many of the neighborhoods. So we consolidate the categories in a broader category. For that I have created a reference as _value_cat.csv_.
